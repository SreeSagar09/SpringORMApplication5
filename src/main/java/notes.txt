A Program to demonstrate how to get record from db by using findByNamedQuery method:
Programs:
* Product.java
* ProductDAO.java
* ProductDAOImpl.java
* ProductDetails.java
* AppConfig.java
* Test.java

* The named query is defined in Hibernate mapping file or in Entity class.
* Defining named query in Entity class by using @NamedQueries and @NamedQuery annotations.

* The findByNamedQuery(String queryName, Object... values) method accept to arguments first one is named query name as String and second one is values as Object arg.
* findByNamedQuery return List.
* If named query is not fined or accessing with different name then exception will throw that is "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No query defined for that name [xxxxxxxxx]"
